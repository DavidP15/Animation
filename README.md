# Animation
Animation Android module developed to be used for games. This is definitely a work in progress.

The goal here is to create a framework to be used for game like animations that can respond to game conditions.

Outside of the animation surface which renders the game animation in a seperate thread, the main elements are a score (to hold a list of channels), a channel (to hold sprites), and sprites (an individual item to be animated such as a character).
